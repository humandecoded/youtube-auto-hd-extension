# youtube-auto-hd-extension
An extension for Chromium based browsers generated by ChatGPT that forces higher quality video streams in the browser. 

## Why?
If you're on Desktop, you likely want the highest quality stream possible. Even when set to "Auto" the streams normally default to HD even when 4k is available.  

## Installation
* Clone this repo
* In your Chromium based browser, navigate to `chrome://extensions`
* Enable `Developer mode`
* `Load Unpacked` and select the folder you just cloned
